Introduction
============

The scripting language we use in Revolution is called Bromscript. This is an advanced scripting language written by one of our own programmers. It's heavily inspired by Lua and C++, with the goal to improve upon the existing Lua syntax. You can read more about it on `the Bromscript website <http://bs.4o3.nl/>`_.

Script entity
=============

The script entity in-game lets you execute scripts when the entity is triggered. These scripts can reference other entities and change their properties.
